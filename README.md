# Little dronekit X Qground control example
drone kit X Qgroundcontrol 

# Install required dependencies 

```
sudo pip install dronekit
  
sudo pip install mavproxy

sudo pip install pymavlink 

sudo pip install dronekit-sitl 

```

For QGroundControl, I've installed this one : https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/releases/tag/v4.1.5

And don't forget to follow the official instructions before the installation: 

https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html

In your terminal run : 

```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER 

sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y 

sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-gl -y 

sudo apt install libqt5gui5 -y 

sudo apt install libfuse2 -y 

```

Then logout and login again.

# Launching the TCP connection 

In a terminal tab run : 

``dronekit-sitl [the model you want] ``

you can find out your options with : 

``dronekit-sitl --list `` 

for this example we're going to use the copter model, so we'll enter :

`` dronekit-sitl copter ``

if your program executes normally, you'll have 

"waiting for connection" at the bottom of your console 

In a new terminal tab, enter the following lines :

`` mavproxy.py --master tcp:127.0.0.1:5760 --out 127.0.0.1:14550 ``

What it does is that Mavproxy creates a TCP server on the 5670 port then forward all the packets on the port 14550. That's where you need to connect on your script.


Then you'll open your ground station, here it's QgroundControl.

There is a known bug between Python scripts and mavlink that disallow any script to control and change the VehicleMode.

It's supposed to be fixed by going back to pymavlink version 2.4.8 but I didn't test it yet because I found a work-around.

It's messy but hey, it works.

You basically have to manually change the VehicleMode on your QGroundStation :

See the "Stabilize" on the top ? Click on it and select "Guided".

Now that it has been done, you can go ahead and launch your script using

`` python (your_script.py) ``

When your script is launched, the "Ready to Fly" will change into a "Communication Lost". Don't worry, communication is lost because your script is now controlling the drone. Now you have to wait until your script finishes and you'll see that your drone moves according to your script.

NB: Sometimes, when you launch your script, it loads "Waiting for arming" for infinity. I have no idea why, so I just Ctrl-C and launch the python command again.

Now, profit !!
